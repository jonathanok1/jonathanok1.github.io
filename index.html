    <p> Welcome to my website! <br>
      My name is Jonathan Ok and this is the first HTML webpage that I have made. On this site, you can find information about me
      and the javascripts program that I will make for one of my classes CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. By clicking the the "about" link, 
      you will be able to learn more information about me personally and my history.
      The "Javascript" link will lead you to all the programs that I created. </p>
